# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

In today's competitive market, understanding your customers is crucial for the success of any business. Customer segmentation, which involves dividing a market into distinct groups of customers that share similar characteristics, is a powerful tool that allows businesses to identify and satisfy the unique needs of different customer groups. By leveraging customer segmentation, companies can outmaneuver the competition by developing products and services that uniquely appeal to each segment.

This project focuses on customer segmentation using a dataset that contains basic customer information, including their ID, sex, marital status, age, education, income, occupation, and settlement size.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

- ID
- Sex
- Marital Status
- Age
- Education
- Income
- Occupation
- Settlement Size


## Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and any other data quality issues.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
- **Clustering:** Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to identify distinct customer segments.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the results using plots and charts to interpret the identified segments.

## Results

The results of this analysis will help our marketing team develop targeted strategies for different customer segments, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and business performance.
